\section{OS Concepts}

\textbf{OS Invokation}
\begin{items}
	\item OS Kernel does \textbf{not} always run in background!
	\item Occasions invoking kernel, switching to kernel mode:
	\begin{enumeration}
		\item \textbf{System calls}: User-Mode processes require higher privileges
		\item \textbf{Interrupts}: CPU-external device sends signal
		\item \textbf{Exceptions}: CPU signals unexpected condition
	\end{enumeration}
\end{items}

\textbf{System calls -- motivation}
\begin{items}
	\item \underline{Problem}: protect processes from one another
	\item \underline{Idea}: Restrict processes by running them in user-mode
	\item \underline{\( \leadsto \) Problem}: now processes cannot manage hardware,... \\*
		who can switch between processes? \\*
		who decides if process may open certain file?
	\item \underline{\( \leadsto \) Idea}: OS provides \textbf{services} to apps \\*
		app calls system if service is needed (\textbf{syscall}) \\*
		OS checks if app is allowed to perform action \\*
		if app may perform action and hasn't exceeded quota, \\* \phantom{x} OS performs action in behalf of app in kernel mode
\end{items}

\textbf{System Calls -- Examples}
\begin{items}
	\item \code{fd = open(file, how,...)} -- open file for read/write/both
	\item documented e.g. in \code{man 2 write}
	\item overview in \code{man 2 syscalls}
\end{items}

\textbf{System Calls vs. APIs}
\begin{items}
	\item \underline{syscalls}: interface between apps and OS services, limited number of well-defined entry points to kernel
	\item \underline{APIs}: often used by programmers to make syscalls \\*
		e.g. \code{printf} library call uses \code{write} syscall
	\item common APIs: Win32, POSIX, C API
\end{items}

\textbf{System Calls -- implementation}
\begin{items}
	\item \emph{trap instruction}: single syscall interface (entry point) to kernel \\*
		switches CPU to kernel mode, enters kernel in same, predefined \\* \phantom{x} way for all syscalls \\*
		system call dispatches then acts as syscall multiplexer
	\item syscalls identified by number passed to trap instruction \\*
		\textbf{syscall table} maps syscall numers to kernel functions \\*
		dispatcher decides where to jump based on number and table \\*
		programs (e.g. \code{stdlib}) have syscall number compiled in! \\*
		\( \leadsto \) never reuse old numbers in future kernel versions
\end{items}

\textbf{Interrupts}
\begin{items}
	\item devices use interrupts to signal predefined conditions to OS \\*
		reminder: device has "`interrupt line"' to CPU \\*
		e.g. device controller informs CPU that operation is finished
	\item \textbf{programmable interrupt controller} manages interrupts \\*
		interrupts can be \textbf{masked} \\*
		masked interrupts: queued, delivered when interrupt unmasked \\*
		queue has finite length \( \leadsto \) interrupts can get lost
	\item noteable interrupt examples:
	\begin{enumeration}
		\item \emph{timer-interrupt}: periodically interrupts processes, switches to kernel \( \leadsto \) can then switch to different processes for fairness
		\item \emph{network interface card} interrupts CPU when packet was received \( \leadsto \) can deliver packet to process and free NIC buffer
	\end{enumeration}
	\item when interrupted, CPU
	\begin{enumeration}
		\item looks up \textbf{interrupt vector} (= table pinned in memory, contains addresses of all service routines)
		\item transfers control to respective \textbf{interrupt service routine} in OS that handles interrupt
	\end{enumeration}
	\item interrupt service routine must first save interrupted processe's state (instruction pointer, stack pointer, status word)
\end{items}

\newpage

\textbf{Exceptions}
\begin{items}
	\item sometimes unusual condition makes it impossible for CPU to continue processing
	\item \( \leadsto \) \textbf{Exception} generated within CPU:
	\begin{enumeration}
		\item CPU interrupts program, gives kernel control
		\item kernel determines reason for exception
		\item if kernel can resolve problem \( \leadsto \) does so, continues \textbf{faulting instruction}
		\item kills process if not
	\end{enumeration}
	\item Difference to Interrupts: interrupts can happen in any context, exceptions always occur asynchronous and in process context
\end{items}

\textbf{OS Concepts -- Physical Memory}
\begin{items}
	\item up to early 60s: \\* 
		- programs loaded and run directly in \emph{physical memory}
		\\*
		- program too large \( \to \) partitioned manually into \emph{overlays}
		\\*
		- OS then swaps overlays between disk and memory
		\\*
		- different jobs could obeserve/modify eachother
\end{items}

\textbf{OS Concepts -- Address Spaces}
\begin{items}
	\item bad programs/people need to be isolated
	\item \underline{Idea}: give every job the illusion of having all memory to itself
		\\*
		every job has own \emph{address space}, can't name addresses of others
		\\*
		jobs always and only use virtual addresses
\end{items}

\textbf{Virtual Memory -- indirect addressing}
\begin{items}
	\item Today: every CPU has built-in \textbf{memory management unit} (\emph{MMU})
	\item MMU translates virtual addresses to physical addresses at every store/load operation
	\item \( \leadsto \) address translation protects one program from another
	\item Definitions:
		\\*
		\textbf{Virtual address}: address in process' address space
		\\*
		\textbf{Physical address}: address of real memory
\end{items}

\textbf{Virtual Memory -- memory protection}
\begin{items}
	\item MMU allows kernel-only virtual addresses
		\\*
		- kernel typically part of all address spaces
		\\*
		- ensures that apps can't touch kernel memory
	\item MMU can enforce \emph{read-only} virtual addresses
		\\*
		- allows safe sharing of memory between apps
	\item MMU can enforce execute disable
		\\*
		- makes code injection attacks harder
\end{items}

\textbf{Virtual Memory -- page faults}
\begin{items}
	\item not all addresses need to be mapped at all times
		\\*
		- MMU issues \emph{page fault} exception when accessed virtual \\* \phantom{-} address isn't mapped
		\\*
		- OS handles page faults by loading faulting addresses and then \\* \phantom{-} continuing the program
		\\*
		- \( \leadsto \) memory can be \textbf{over-committed}: more memory than \\* \phantom{-} physically available can be allocated to application
	\item page faults also issued by MMU on illegal memory accesses
\end{items}

\textbf{OS Concepts -- Processes}
\begin{items}
	\item = program in execution ("`instance"' of program)
	\item each process is associated with a \textbf{process control block} (\emph{PCB})
		\\*
		contains information about allocated resources
	\item each process is associated with a virtual \textbf{address space} (\emph{AS})
		\\*
		- all (virtual) memory locations a program can name
		\\*
		- starts at 0 and runs up to a maximum
		\\*
		- address 123 in AS1 generally \( \neq \) address 123 in AS2
		\\*
		- indirect addressing \( \leadsto \) different ASes to different programs
		\\*
		- \( \leadsto \) protection between processes
\end{items}

\newpage

\textbf{OS Concepts -- address space layout}
\begin{items}
	\item address spaces typically laid-out in different \textbf{sections}
		\\*
		- memory addresses between sections \textbf{illegal}
		\\*
		- illegal addresses \( \leadsto \) page fault
		\\*
		- more specifically calles \textbf{segmentation fault}
		\\*
		- OS usually kills process causing segmentation fault
	\item \textbf{Stack}: function history, local variables
	\item \textbf{Data}: Constants, static/global variables, strings
	\item \textbf{Text}: Program code
