\section{Introduction to Operating Systems}

\textbf{What's an OS?}
\begin{items}
	\item \underline{abstraction}: provides abstraction for applications \\*
		manages and hides hardware details \\*
		uses low-level interfaces (not available to applications) \\*
		multiplexes hardware to multiple programs (\emph{virtualisation}) \\*
		makes hardware use efficient for applications
	\item \underline{protection}: \\*
		from processes using up all resources (\emph{accounting}, \emph{allocation}) \\*
		from processes writing into other processes memory
	\item \underline{resource managing}: \\*
		manages + multiplexes hardware resources \\*
		decides between conflicting requests for resource use \\*
		strives for efficient + fair resource use
	\item \underline{control}: \\*
		controls program execution \\*
		prevents errors and improper computer use
	\item \( \leadsto \) \textbf{no universially accepted definition}
